# AMAKZON #

This project aims to duplicate a fake marketplace of weapons

##  Access to the Application ##
### Requirements ###

Having php installed. If not, run :
        
    sudo apt install php7.4-cli

### Local Server ###
You can test the website on a local server. You must clone the repository :

    git clone https://github.com/PouxvielAdrien/Amakzon.git


Then you need to be in the current folder 'Amakzon' and run :
        
    php -S localhost:8080

Now just open your browser at the localhost address.

### Browser  ###

I installed apache and used an AWS E2C to host the website.

It is reachable at the address : `ec2-13-38-245-163.eu-west-3.compute.amazonaws.com`

Note : I need to launch the e2c instance to access it, so tell me if you want to do it

##  Todo ##

    - Manage the routes of the website
    - Change the public DNS
